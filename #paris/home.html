            <div id="word">PARIS</div>, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art,
            fashion and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine with
            an area of about 105.4 km² with the population of 2.148 million(Jan 1, 2020). The weather around Paris is
            usually chill and beautiful. It is one of the most visited tourist destination in the world, with over 45
            million visitors annually.The City of Light nickname has been used to refer to the Age of Enlightenment in
            Paris, bringing to the fore poets, philosophers, scientists and engineers who all played a part in the
            city’s development. Thanks to its stunning architecture, its wealth of art and culture and its exquisite
            gastronomy that will leave you feeling blissful. No matter what time of year you visit, Paris will be sure
            to enamour and enchant with its picture-perfect landscapes and world-class museums.
            <p>One of the best things about Paris is that it is a small, big city that is very accessible. Just walking
                around the city seems fun. The metro gets you just about everywhere, and it’s very rare that you need to
                make a transfer more than once. We rarely need more than 30-40 minutes to get most places in the city.
                This city inspires you and sparkles your curosity. While visiting Paris, don't just follow a checklist
                of all the tourist sites you think you're supposed to see. Sometimes seeking out an exhibition of your
                favorite artist, visiting a French comic book shop, or looking for unique bookstores is more
                interesting. You don’t have to do everything in one visit. You can always come back.</p>
